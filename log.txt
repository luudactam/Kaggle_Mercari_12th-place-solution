WARNING:tensorflow:From /opt/conda/lib/python3.6/site-packages/tensorflow/python/util/deprecation.py:497: calling conv1d (from tensorflow.python.ops.nn_ops) with data_format=NHWC is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.
Instructions for updating:
`NHWC` for data_format is deprecated, use `NWC` instead
